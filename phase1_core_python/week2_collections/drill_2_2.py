Drill 2.2 — List Transformations

Goal:
    Transform lists using comprehensions

Task:
    Write square_all(nums) that squares each number

Rules:
    - Write the solution yourself
    - Keep it readable
    - Add at least 2 test cases

Reflection:
    When would you use list comprehensions vs loops?
