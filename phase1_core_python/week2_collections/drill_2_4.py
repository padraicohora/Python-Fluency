Drill 2.4 — Safe Dict Access

Goal:
    Handle missing dictionary keys safely

Task:
    Write get_value(d, key) that returns 'missing' if key absent

Rules:
    - Write the solution yourself
    - Keep it readable
    - Add at least 2 test cases

Reflection:
    What is the .get() method and when should you use it?
