"""
Drill 3.4 — Helper Functions

Goal:
    Decompose problems into helper functions

Task:
    Refactor a messy function into smaller helper functions

Rules:
    - Write the solution yourself
    - Keep it readable
    - Add at least 2 test cases

Reflection:
    Why do senior engineers care about decomposition?
