"""
Drill 3.6 — Error Handling

Goal:
    Handle errors gracefully

Task:
    Write safe_divide(a, b) that returns None for division by zero

Rules:
    - Write the solution yourself
    - Keep it readable
    - Add at least 2 test cases

Reflection:
    When should you raise exceptions vs return None?
