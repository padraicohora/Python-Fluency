Drill 0.0: Hello World Script

Goal:
    Create and run your first Python script from the terminal

Task:
    Write a script that prints a greeting message

Rules:
    - Write the solution yourself
    - Keep it readable
    - Run from terminal with: python3 drill_00_hello.py

Reflection:
    What's the difference between running a script and using a Python REPL?
