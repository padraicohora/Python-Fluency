# Python Fluency Drills

This repository is a structured daily drill program to build real Python fluency,
from core language mastery through ML-ready data skills.

The goal is to become confident writing Python scripts in a professional workflow
(not notebook-only), with strong fundamentals, clean code habits, and disciplined practice.

## Structure

The repo is organized in phases:

- **Phase 0** — Environment + workflow basics (terminal, scripts, git, venv)
- **Phase 1** — Core Python fluency (syntax, collections, functions, OOP)
- **Phase 2** — ML-ready Python (stdlib tools, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

Each drill is:

- One standalone `.py` file
- Designed for ~15–20 minutes
- Includes a small test + reflection prompt
- Written by me, not copied from an LLM
